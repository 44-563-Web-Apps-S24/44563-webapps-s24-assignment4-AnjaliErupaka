            <p class="speech">The train's arrived, thank God. What's the time?</p> 

            <h3 class="DUNYASHA">DUNYASHA</h3>
            <p class="speech">The dogs didn't sleep all night; they know that they're coming.</p>
              
            <h3 class="EPIKHODOV">EPIKHODOV</h3>
            <p class="directions">[Enters with a bouquet. He wears a short jacket and
            brilliantly polished boots which squeak audibly. He drops the bouquet as
            he enters, then picks it up]</p>
            <p class="speech">The gardener sent these; says they're to go
            into the dining-room.</p>
            <p class="directions">[Gives the bouquet to DUNYASHA.]</p>

            <h3 class="LOPAKHIN">LOPAKHIN</h3>
            <p class="speech"> And you'll bring me some kvass.</p>

            <h3 class="DUNYASHA">DUNYASHA</h3>
            <p class="speech"> Very well. </p>

            <h3 class="EPIKHODOV">EPIKHODOV</h3>
            <p class="speech"> There's a frost this morning--three degrees, and the
            cherry-trees are all in flower. I can't approve of our climate.</p>
            <p class="directions">[Sighs]</p>
            <p class="speech">I can't. Our climate is indisposed to favour us even this once. And,
            Ermolai Alexeyevitch, allow me to say to you, in addition, that I bought
            myself some boots two days ago, and I beg to assure you that they squeak
            in a perfectly unbearable manner. What shall I put on them?</p>

            <h3 class="LOPAKHIN">LOPAKHIN</h3>
            <p class="speech">  Go away. You bore me.</p>

            <h3 class="DUNYASHA">DUNYASHA</h3>
            <p class="speech"> I may confess to you, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that Epikhodov has
            proposed to me.</p>

            <h3 class="LOPAKHIN">LOPAKHIN</h3>
            <p class="speech"> Ah!</p>

            <p class="directions"> [Listens] </p>
            <p class="speech">There they come, I think.</p>

            <h3 class="DUNYASHA">DUNYASHA</h3>
            <p class="speech"> They're coming! What's the matter with me? I'm cold all over.</p>

            <h3 class="LOPAKHIN">LOPAKHIN</h3>
            <p class="speech"> There they are, right enough. Let's go and meet them. Will she
            know me? We haven't seen each other for five years. </p>

            <h3 class="DUNYASHA">DUNYASHA</h3> 
            <p class="directions">[Excited] </p>
