                THE CHERRY ORCHARD Act 1 by Anton Chekov
            </h2>

              <p>LOPAKHIN. The train's arrived, thank God. What's the time?</p> 

              <p>DUNYASHA. The dogs didn't sleep all night; they know that they're coming.</p>
              
               <p>EPIKHODOV. [Enters with a bouquet. He wears a short jacket and
                brilliantly polished boots which squeak audibly. He drops the bouquet as
                he enters, then picks it up] The gardener sent these; says they're to go
                into the dining-room. [Gives the bouquet to DUNYASHA.]</p>

                <p>LOPAKHIN. And you'll bring me some kvass.</p>

                <p>DUNYASHA. Very well. [Exit.]</p>

                <p>EPIKHODOV. There's a frost this morning--three degrees, and the
                    cherry-trees are all in flower. I can't approve of our climate. [Sighs]
                    I can't. Our climate is indisposed to favour us even this once. And,
                    Ermolai Alexeyevitch, allow me to say to you, in addition, that I bought
                    myself some boots two days ago, and I beg to assure you that they squeak
                    in a perfectly unbearable manner. What shall I put on them?</p>

                <p>LOPAKHIN. Go away. You bore me.</p>
                <p>EPIKHODOV. Some misfortune happens to me every day. But I don't
                    complain; I'm used to it, and I can smile. [DUNYASHA comes in and
                    brings LOPAKHIN some kvass] I shall go. [Knocks over a chair] There....
                    [Triumphantly] There, you see, if I may use the word, what circumstances
                    I am in, so to speak. It is even simply marvellous. [Exit.]</p>

                <p>DUNYASHA. I may confess to you, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that Epikhodov has
                    proposed to me.</p>

                <p>LOPAKHIN. Ah!</p>

                <p>DUNYASHA. I don't know what to do about it. He's a nice young man, but
                    every now and again, when he begins talking, you can't understand a word
                    he's saying. I think I like him. He's madly in love with me. He's an
                    unlucky man; every day something happens. We tease him about it. They
                    call him "Two-and-twenty troubles."</p>

                <p>LOPAKHIN. [Listens] There they come, I think.</p>

                <p>DUNYASHA. They're coming! What's the matter with me? I'm cold all over.</p>

                <p>LOPAKHIN. There they are, right enough. Let's go and meet them. Will she
                        know me? We haven't seen each other for five years. </p>

                <p>DUNYASHA. [Excited] I shall faint in a minute.... Oh, I'm fainting</p>
